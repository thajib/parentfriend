This android application will be used by users to schedule uptime/unlock time on android phones.
Users can setup multiple time slots when the phone is allowed to stay unlocked.
When phone is found unlocked and its not in the time slots scheduled, notification messages are popped up until the user locks the phone.

The implementation is based on kivy and python for android
